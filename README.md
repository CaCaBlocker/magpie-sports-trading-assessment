Given a set of market pricing data (found here: mocki.io/v1/70f45519-0232-463b-bd4f-88e9d7213d26), we would like you to create a small web application that does the following:

- Retrieves the data from the above URL.
- Transforms the data, calculating the following for each unique item in the set:
    1. average price
    2. lower bound
    3. upper bound
    4. standard deviation
    5. peak price and day it occurred
- Displays the collated data in a readable format for the user. (React UI)
- Provides a React UI for the user to download the transformed data in their choice of the following formats: JSON, CSV, or .xlsx.
